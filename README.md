3.	About the App.

•	The purpose of my app is to allow users to utilize a History flashcards game to test their knowledge on History-related questions.
•	The app possesses 5 history-related questions, and they would need to answer with a True or False answer.   
•	To answer the question, a user is presented with two True or False buttons. IIE 2025
•	When the users have answered the question, the True or False buttons fade away, and only the next button remains open for users to click to move to the next question.
•	If a user gets an answer wrong, they get a message on the Text View advising them that their answer was “Incorrect” and if they get the answer right there’s a text view to show them that their answer is “Correct”. 
•	The loop then goes through the array of 5 questions as well as the answers, and stops when it reaches the 5th item in the array.  IIE 2025.
•	When a user clicks the next button after they’ve answered the 5th question, they are directed to the score page displaying the total they have acquired. 
•	For a score of 3 and above, the total would be accompanied by a text-view message stating “Great Job”.  IIE 2025
•	For a score of 2 and below, the total is accompanied by a “Keep Practising” text.
•	Lastly, the app reviews the scores and lets the user know which questions they got correct or incorrect. IIE 2025
•	The Exit button on the score page allows users to exit the quiz. IIE 2025.
